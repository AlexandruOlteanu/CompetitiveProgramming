GCD

        1) In order to calculate how many pairs (x, y) have gcd(x, y) = k
        you can have the formula: 
            gcd(x, y, k) = how many pairs x, y have gcd = k
            cnt(x, y, k) = how many pairs x, y have the divizor k (not gcd) 
            
            Then:
            gcd(x, y, k) = cnt(x, y, k) - gcd(x, y, 2k) - gcd(x, y, 3k) - gcd(x, y, 4k) .... 

            So you can go backwards and calculate gcd(x, y, k) for all k from 1 to MAX with compelxity
            O(M * log2(M))

            For this you can also use mobius formula but it's not that flexible inbetween calculations
